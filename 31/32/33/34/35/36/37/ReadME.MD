# 📄 Short Overview: DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript

The **DOM** is a programming interface provided by browsers to represent and interact with HTML or XML documents. It turns the document into a structured tree (a.k.a. DOM Tree) that JavaScript can manipulate.

## 🏗️ DOM Tree Structure

Each HTML element becomes a **node** in the DOM:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
  </body>
</html>
